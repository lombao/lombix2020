# PREFIX: Where the package is going to be installed. 
# If you are familiar with autotools you know what prefix usually means
PREFIX=/usr

##
# CREDITS: Files that specifically you want to be copied over from 
# the source code into the credits area. The installer will automatically

# strip --strip-unneeded over all the files from the PREFIX. This eliminates
# debug symbols and reduce the size of binaries ( execs and libs ). 
DOSTRIP=no
