##
# PREFIX: Where the package is going to be installed. 
# If you are familiar with autotools you know what prefix usually means
PREFIX=/usr

##
# CREDITS: Files that specifically you want to be copied over from 
# the source code into the credits area. The installer will automatically
# try to copy a wide range of files but if you want any particular file to 
# added , just write it here
CREDITS="protobuf-3.6.1/CONTRIBUTORS.txt protobuf-3.6.1/LICENSE"

##
# STRIP: Afer the installation the installer will try to execute a
# strip --strip-unneeded over all the files from the PREFIX. This eliminates
# debug symbols and reduce the size of binaries ( execs and libs ). 
DOSTRIP=no
