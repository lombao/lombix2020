# PREFIX: Where the package is going to be installed. 
# If you are familiar with autotools you know what prefix usually means

##
# CREDITS: Files that specifically you want to be copied over from 
# the source code into the credits area. The installer will automatically

# STRIP: Afer the installation the installer will try to execute a
# strip --strip-unneeded over all the files from the PREFIX. This eliminates
# debug symbols and reduce the size of binaries ( execs and libs ).
